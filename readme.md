# Mac Scripting Public Repo

This is a simple repo of various scripts that have particularly useful functionality in day-to-day operation on a Mac OS system.

Most of these should stand up fairly far back in the OS release history, as many of these scripts have been with me for quite a while.

As for executing these scripts, I usually trigger the Applescripts via the brilliant (no, really, *brilliant*) [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com "Go ahead. Click it.") Before Keyboard Maestro, I used the first, the original, QuicKeys *(RIP)*. When QuicKeys ceased being truly usable, I never missed a beat switching from QuicKeys *(RIP)* to Keyboard Maestro, though, and <acronym title="Change is hard. And, yes, I know an acronym tag is not proper here.">I actually find it more powerful</acronym>, if not as user-friendly as QuicKeys *(RIP)*. I will try to remember to include the keyboard shortcuts that I use in the comments of each script.

As for the shell scripts, they're usually triggered by `cron`, which I know is deprecated, but I love it. You can't stop me.

So, I hope these help. Some of these really required some thrashing around to come up with, so hopefully you can just plug and play. Of course, I can't offer support, but you can always ask away, if I have time I'll answer. :)

Happy scripting.
