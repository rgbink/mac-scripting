#Dialectic Phone Dialing via LaunchBar
##What it does: Choose Dialectic Dial Method before Dialing via LaunchBar

This is a script I use—well, *invoke*—multiple times a day. The excellent Mac launcher, [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/launchbar/ "LaunchBar 6"), by [Objective Development](http://www.obdev.at/ "Objective Development"), allows a setting in its preferences to determine what happens when one hits the `enter` key when a phone number is selected. The default, if I recall correctly, is to display the number in large type. But the solitary additional option is to link to a script. This is my script.

What it does is intercept the [default Dialectic script](http://www.jonn8.com/dialectic/resources/) and allow you to choose which method to use. If you only have one dial method, you **DO NOT** need this script. Just use the default script provided by the Dialectic creator (this is based on that one.)

If you *do* have multiple dial methods (I have Skype, Cell phone (via Bluetooth), Home, and Business phone profiles), you will appreciate the ability to choose from among them before sending the number on to Dialectic.

Enjoy.
####Pro Tip: When the dialog appears, choose your method by typing the first letter of its name on the keyboard and hitting `Enter.`
